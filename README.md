# T-Rex

This is the next step in my "Wooden Menagerie" project. I decided to make a t-rex in the same general style as the animals that I had previously made. This was also an experiment to see how patterns in laser cut wood would flex as a pivot to mimic body motions.

## Files

There are two folders of files, one has the original solidworks files, the other has the DXF files for cutting with a laser.

The solidworks model allows you to adjust, recreate, change and do whatever you would like to the overall t-rex design and model. You can also easily move the model around in a 3D environment in order to see what parts go where when building the t-rex.

The DXF files are what you will use to cut out all of the pieces. DXF files are flat files that give the laser a path to follow for cutting parts. There are also nested files with all the parts already laid out. There is a file for a laser that can accommodate 24" x 36" material. In order to cut all the parts out on a laser that can handle 20" x 32", there are two separate files to cut. I have provided three different types of files, Illustrator, PDF, and DXF. All are the same and should provide the same outcome.

The one excel file is for the number of parts needed of each different shape. Some of the parts are needed twice, four times, some 16+. Using this file when laying out all the parts for nesting is very helpful.

## Materials

This t-rex was designed with 1/8" material in mind, that could be wood, plastic, or anything really as long as it can be cut properly and is the right thickness.

The holes are all designed to fit 3/16" dowels.

Ideally, I'd love to see this made with bright green, clear plastic and metal rods for all the pivots.

## Process

The same as the previous creatures, when constructing this dinosaur, I would suggest dry fitting parts and pivot shafts before using some kind of adhesive to finalize the position. I suggest using super glue or fast dry epoxy.

The first step is to cut all your parts out with a laser or router. Once you have your pieces, start to assemble, using dry fits to determine how long each pivot rod needs to be for each area.

When gluing together pivots, be careful not to glue faces together that should still slide, this will ruin your pivot and make a messy model.

## Changes

There might be changes made to the model in the future to fix problems and enhance the movement.
